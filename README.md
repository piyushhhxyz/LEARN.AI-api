  "text": "00:00:00\nlast week I went to CES in Las Vegas but\n00:00:02\nI nearly my pants when I saw this AI\n00:00:04\npowered smart toilet from Coler it's got\n00:00:06\nheated seats ambient lighting and\n00:00:08\nemergency flushing capabilities for\n00:00:10\npower outages during the apocalypse but\n00:00:12\nsomething doesn't smell right with its\n00:00:13\n$88,500 price tag today we'll look at\n00:00:15\nall the craziest Tech from CES 2024 to\n00:00:18\nget a glimpse into our Aid driven\n00:00:19\ndystopian future it is January 15th 2024\n00:00:23\nand you're watching the code report the\n00:00:24\nbig theme at CES was you guessed it\n00:00:26\nartificial intelligence and even implied\n00:00:28\nthat traditional coding langu are dead\n00:00:30\nin the keynote programming language of\n00:00:32\nthe next decade is not going to be the\n00:00:34\ntraditional way that we've been writing\n00:00:36\ncode it's just going to be natural\n00:00:38\nlanguage what's funny though is that\n00:00:39\nliterally nothing at CSS is actually\n00:00:41\nbuilt with AI the reality is that\n00:00:43\neverything's built with C++ Python and\n00:00:45\nJavaScript coded by humans however AI is\n00:00:48\nputting many careers on The Chopping\n00:00:49\nBlock like professional bird watchers\n00:00:51\nare in big trouble thanks to these new\n00:00:52\nAI powered binoculars that can\n00:00:54\nautomatically identify government spies\n00:00:56\nAKA Birds but if you think software\n00:00:58\nengineering is obsolete another career\n00:00:59\nyou might be considering is a tractor\n00:01:01\noperator unfortunately those jobs belong\n00:01:03\nto the robots multiple companies like\n00:01:05\nJohn Deere are now showcasing driverless\n00:01:07\ntractors and Hyundai's concept X\n00:01:09\nexcavator in the near future robots like\n00:01:11\nthis will build in police linear smart\n00:01:13\ncities just like the one that's under\n00:01:14\nconstruction in neom Saudi Arabia right\n00:01:16\nnow with minimal manual labor or\n00:01:18\nsupervision from humans but even if you\n00:01:20\nfind yourself doing manual labor in the\n00:01:21\nfuture it'll be a lot more productive\n00:01:23\nthanks to AI powered exoskeletons this\n00:01:26\nprox exoskeleton from hypershell is an\n00:01:28\nAI powered suit that can make you run\n00:01:30\nfaster jump higher and kickass harder\n00:01:32\nit's got a 1 horsepower motor that can\n00:01:34\nget you running over 12 mph the most\n00:01:36\nobvious application for such a tool is\n00:01:38\nfor the military and law enforcement\n00:01:39\neventually every police officer and\n00:01:41\nSoldier will be an Unstoppable Cyborg\n00:01:43\nand that's great for Humanity because we\n00:01:44\ncan finally eradicate crime once and for\n00:01:46\nall but crime is a small problem\n00:01:48\ncompared to the upcoming climate\n00:01:49\ncatastrophe if we don't do something\n00:01:51\nalgor is predicting the ice caps will be\n00:01:53\ntotally melted by 2013 it's all your\n00:01:55\nfault but luckily our trusted world\n00:01:56\nleaders are flying around on their\n00:01:58\nprivate jets trying to figure out a\n00:01:59\nsolution tion like did you know Bill\n00:02:00\nGates had to buy four different private\n00:02:02\njets that's your fault he's trying to\n00:02:03\nsave the world from useless carbon\n00:02:05\nemitters like you but don't worry a\n00:02:06\nfinal solution is coming another huge\n00:02:08\ntheme at CES was electric vehicles\n00:02:10\nMercedes dropped a new all electric G\n00:02:12\nwagon and there are tons of different\n00:02:13\ncool looking EVS from Brands I've never\n00:02:15\neven heard of and this is all happening\n00:02:17\nwhile demand is slowing for EVS in the\n00:02:19\nUnited States which means these cars\n00:02:20\nwill likely get cheaper and cheaper in\n00:02:22\nthe years ahead but EVS aren't even all\n00:02:23\nthat much better for the environment\n00:02:25\ncompared to ice the real problem is that\n00:02:26\nthere's too many humans consuming too\n00:02:28\nmuch stuff but most of them are not\n00:02:29\nwilling to get into the sarop Pod yet on\n00:02:31\ntop of that many people have pets like\n00:02:33\ncats and dogs also useless carbon\n00:02:35\nemitters luckily Samsung introduced a\n00:02:37\nnew robot called Bali a cute little\n00:02:39\nrobot kind of like Wall-E it's a far\n00:02:40\nsuperior cat or dog replacement it's\n00:02:42\npowered by Ai and has a built-in\n00:02:44\nprojector that can play videos on any\n00:02:46\nwall or act as a little security bot\n00:02:48\nthat can keep your house safe while\n00:02:49\nyou're away pretty cool but one of the\n00:02:51\nmost hyped up products at CES was the\n00:02:53\nrabbit R1 it's a handheld AI assistant\n00:02:56\nthat's kind of like if a smartphone and\n00:02:57\nAlexa had a baby basically it Con\n00:02:59\nconects to the apps in your phone and\n00:03:01\nallows you to control them with natural\n00:03:02\nlanguage as opposed to their actual uis\n00:03:05\nthanks to their own custom Foundation\n00:03:06\nmodel which they call a large action\n00:03:08\nmodel some people have called this the\n00:03:10\niPhone moment for the AI era essentially\n00:03:12\nthe rabbit R1 makes UI obsolete you can\n00:03:15\nremove the word front- end development\n00:03:16\nfrom the dictionary because with the\n00:03:17\nrabbit R1 all you have to do is talk\n00:03:19\ninto the device like you're talking to a\n00:03:20\nhuman and it can do all those things you\n00:03:22\nused to do with your fingers on your\n00:03:23\napps the rabbit sold all 10,000 of its\n00:03:25\nunits the first day it was released but\n00:03:27\npersonally I think this thing is\n00:03:28\noverhyped you could Lally just build an\n00:03:30\napp that does the same thing instead of\n00:03:32\ncarrying a second piece of Hardware\n00:03:33\naround with you oh wait it looks like\n00:03:35\nsomeone already built that app with\n00:03:36\nflutter overall CES was totally\n00:03:37\noverwhelming like I didn't even mention\n00:03:39\nthe Y brush that can brush your teeth in\n00:03:40\n10 seconds or the new Hyundai electric\n00:03:42\nair taxi or the transparent TVs from\n00:03:44\nSamsung and LG or the analog keyboard\n00:03:46\nfor your smartphone or how about the\n00:03:48\nsmart lamp that watches you at all times\n00:03:49\nto keep you safe or come take a load off\n00:03:51\nwith one of these fully immersive VR and\n00:03:53\nAI powered reciprocating devices CES was\n00:03:55\na lot of fun but now it's your turn to\n00:03:57\nserve your life's purpose and go out and\n00:03:59\nbuy all this useless Crow this has been\n00:04:00\nthe code report thanks for watching and\n00:04:02\nI will see you in the next one"
